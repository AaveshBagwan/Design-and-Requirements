Solution :

-> three apis will be created 
	getTest -> to get the test
	submitTest -> to submit the test
	viewTest -> to view test

-> four tables will be created
	question_master -> to store all the questions
	answer_master -> to store all the answers of each question
	test_master -> to store the test created for the user
	test_question_map -> to store the mapping of the questions generated for the each test and the answers sequence generated for the each questions

-> as user start the test getTest API will be called,
-> in getTest API, 
1. if there are any unattempted test are available for the user in test_master table then that test will be returned.
2. if above condition is not met 
	2.1 then generate the random test by picking 10 random question from the question_master.
	2.2 then answers for the picked question from answer_master table, As of now we have number of option for one question as 4 only,
	    so after picking all four answers shuffle the set of answers to get randomness (use shuffle method of collections in java for random sequence)
	2.3 then store the randomly generated test to the test_master and test_question_map table and return it to the user.
3. for generating random question from the table we will use the Random() function along with the order by clause and limit clause in sql.
	3.1 e.g. select * from question_master where status = 'A' order by RANDOM() LIMIT 10 , 
	    this query will give us random 10 question rows from table question_master where status is 'A'


-> after the test is completed the user submitTest api will be called
-> in submitTest API
1. check the question and there corresponding the answers given by user from the answer_master table.
2. then calculated score based upon that if score is above 80% user has passed that test otherwise failed the test.
3. then mark the test as attempted in the test_master table's is_attempted column as 'Y' and insert the score of the test as well.
4. then return the score and highest score to the user.

-> after the test submition if user wants to view the answers then viewTest will be called
1. in this get the test_id and return the test corresponding to the test id from the test_master, the test_question_map and answer_master table by selecting the correct answers among the given options for any particular question of the test.
